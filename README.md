# FabricAutoCrafter
## A Fabric mod that adds a new Auto Crafter block

This mod adds a new block, the Auto Crafter. It allows you to put items in the crafting table and get an output. Hoppers and droppers do interact with the table.

Some code belongs to Gnembon. We were going to fork it, but the changes in this mod required a complete restructure of the mod.

Features that differ from Gnembon's mod:
- We don't overwrite the crafting table
- Uses Polymer to add a new Crafting Table
- Fixes a recipe book issue
- Fixes item filters not working
- Adds a recipe for the Auto Crafter
- Fixes an out-of-bounds exception
- Adds Server-Side Translations
